# my-portfolio

[my-portfolio on heroku](https://nameless-castle-45341.herokuapp.com)

The directions were to make a responsive portfolio that was mobile responsive. I started by making three HTML documents named index.html, portfolio.html as well as linking my resume and social media at the bottem of the page. I was able to accomplish mobile and different platform compatibility by utilizing the materialize and changing the column sizes. I further utilized materialize to make a navbar and used forms for my contacts page. 

I am looking forward to the feedback I receive from this project to learn how to improve as a web developer and how I can better hone my abilities.

## Installation

The installation for this project is to go my github repositories then navigate to my portfolio or click this link [my-portfolio](https://github.com/hondahelix/my-portfolio) then click on the green code button in the top right. Then you can copy the code via ssh or by downloading a zip file.


## Usage 

Although this version of my portfolio is better than my first one i know there is much to be improved and I want to add some more interesting features such as connecting it to a database so that people can leave comments. The project's usage is that I now have a place to display my future projects. This portfolio will continue to improve as I further learn and practice.
